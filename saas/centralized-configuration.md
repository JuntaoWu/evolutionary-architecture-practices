# Centralized Configuration

Unlike a monolithic app in which everything runs within a single instance, a cloud-native application consists of independent services distributed across virtual machines, containers, and geographic regions. 

Managing configuration settings for dozens of interdependent services can be challenging. Duplicate copies of configuration settings across different locations are error prone and difficult to manage. 

Centralized configuration is a critical requirement for distributed cloud-native applications.
