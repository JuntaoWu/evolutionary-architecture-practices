# What is SaaS

**Software as a service** (**SaaS** [/sæs/](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Help:IPA/English)[\[1\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_as_a_service#cite_note-1)) is a [software licensing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_licensing) and [delivery](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_delivery) model in which [software](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software) is licensed on a [subscription](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subscription) basis and is centrally [hosted](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_hosting_service).[\[2\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_as_a_service#cite_note-2)[\[3\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_as_a_service#cite_note-3) It is sometimes referred to as "on-demand software", and was formerly referred to as "software plus services" by [Microsoft](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft).[\[4\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_as_a_service#cite_note-4) SaaS applications are also known as on-demand software and Web-based/Web-hosted software. 

Since SaaS is a definition for a centralized application delivery model, we can go through a brief history of software delivering.

**1989:** Invention of the World Wide Web

**1990s:** Enterprise app suites move to client-server architectures and mainframe computing

**1990s:** First SaaS application introduced, managed hosting services, ASPs (Single-tenant)

**1998:** 1st Multi-tenant SaaS app

**2000s: **SaaS app suites and ecosystems such as Salesforce begin to emerge

**2010: **Salesforce led the way to prove that SaaS is the future of software delivery

**2010-Now:** Refined SaaS products that include almost everything that was available as a packaged software

In the early 1960s, very few SMBs could afford to buy one for themselves, which led to the birth of time sharing or utility computing systems. These systems refer to terminals connected to a centralized computer or a mainframe.

In the 1990s, a new centralized model ASP(Application Service Provider) took the footprints. ASPs provided businesses with the service of hosting and managing specialized business applications, to reduce costs through central administration and the solution provider's specialization in a particular business application.

Today, SaaS extends the idea of ASP model.

* While most initial ASP's focused on managing and hosting third-party [independent software vendors](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Independent_software_vendor)' software, as of 2012 SaaS vendors typically develop and manage their own software.[\[14\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_as_a_service#cite_note-14)
* Whereas many initial ASPs offered more traditional [client–server](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Client%E2%80%93server_model) applications, which require installation of software on users' [personal computers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Personal_computer), SaaS solutions of today rely predominantly [on the Web](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_application) and only requires a web browser to use.[\[15\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_as_a_service#cite_note-15)
* Whereas the [software architecture](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_architecture) used by most initial ASPs mandated maintaining a separate instance of the application for each business, as of 2012 SaaS solutions normally utilize a [multi-tenant](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multitenancy) architecture, in which the application serves multiple businesses and users, and partitions its data accordingly.
